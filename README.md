# reinforced_learning_maze
A python implementation of reinforced learning for a maze problem with random generated goal, traps and walls.

The implementation is inspired and adapted from [Corentin Dancette](https://cdancette.fr/#) which can handle multiple obstacles to create a 2D maze in which an agent is trained through reinforced learning to find the way to the exit.
